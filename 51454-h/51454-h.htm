3</span>PREFACE.</h2>
<p>Although what is contained in the following pages should
explain itself, a few prefatory remarks may not be out of
place.&nbsp; In the <i>Scottish Churches and the Gipsies</i> I
said that, &ldquo;in regard to the belief about the destiny of
the Gipsies,&rdquo; &ldquo;almost all have joined in it, as
something established&rdquo;&mdash;that &ldquo;the Gipsies
&lsquo;cease to be Gipsies&rsquo; by conforming, in a great
measure, with the dress and habits of others, and keeping silence
as to their being members of the race;&rdquo; and that &ldquo;in
bringing forward this subject for discussion and action I thus
find the way barred in every direction.&rdquo;&nbsp; Although I
have said that the belief about the disappearance, or rather the
<i>extinction</i>, of the race has been tacitly if not formally
maintained by almost everyone, &ldquo;no one seems inclined to
give a reason for this belief in regard to the destiny of the
Gipsies, nor an intelligible definition of the word
Gipsy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is the position in which the Gipsy problem stands
to-day.&nbsp; The latest work on the subject which I have seen is
that of <i>The Gipsies</i> (New York, 1882), by Mr. Leland, so
fully reviewed in the following pages.&nbsp; He leaves the
question, in its most important meaning, just where he found it;
and confesses that it has &ldquo;puzzled and muddled&rdquo;
him.&nbsp; In 1874 I wrote in <i>Contributions to Natural
History</i>, <i>etc.</i>, as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;What becomes of the Gipsies is a question
that cannot be settled by reference to any of Mr. Borrow&rsquo;s
writings, although these contain a few incidental remarks that
throw some light on it when information of a positive and
circumstantial nature is added&rdquo; (p. 120).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In offering to a London journal the double-article on <i>Mr.
Leland on the Gipsies</i> I said, on the 30th May,
1882:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I admit that it is a very difficult and
delicate matter for a journal to &lsquo;go back on&rsquo; a
position once taken up on any question; but I think that if you
admit the intended article the point will be gained, without any
responsibility on the part of the journal or editor;&rdquo; and
that the insertion of it would put the journal &ldquo;in its
proper position before the world, without recanting
anything.&rdquo;&nbsp; I further wrote that &ldquo;Purely
literary journals must necessarily labour under great
disadvantages when called on to notice a book on a very special
subject, unless they can find a writer who can do it for
them.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If all that has been written on the Gipsies &ldquo;ceasing to
be Gipsies,&rdquo; under any circumstances, &ldquo;be allowed to
go uncontradicted, it will become rooted in the public mind, and
gather credit as time goes by, making it daily more difficult to
set it <a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
4</span>aside, and allow truth to take its place&rdquo;&mdash;as
I wrote in reply to two fulsome eulogies on Charles Waterton.</p>
<p>There are various phenomena connected with the subject of the
Gipsies; not the least striking one being the popular impression
about the <i>extinction</i> of the <i>race</i> by its <i>changing
its habits</i>, which has been arrived at without investigation
and evidence, and against all analogy and the &ldquo;nature of
things.&rdquo;&nbsp; So fully has this idea taken possession of
the public mind that a hearing on the true position of the
question can scarcely be had.&nbsp; One purpose this has served,
that it has saved the public almost every serious thought or care
in regard to its duty towards the race, and relieved it of every
<i>ultimate</i> responsibility connected with it.&nbsp; But that
is not a becoming position for any people to occupy&mdash;that of
getting rid of its obligations by ignoring them.&nbsp; In 1871 I
wrote thus:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The subject of the Gipsies, so far as it is
understood . . . presents little interest to the world if it
means only <i>a certain style of life</i> that may <i>cease at
any moment</i>; in which case it would be deserving of little
notice.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But all of the aspects connected with the popular idea of a
Gipsy are of interest and importance when they represent the
primitive condition of a people who sooner or later pass into a
more or less settled condition, and look back to the style of
life of their ancestors.&nbsp; In this respect the Gipsies differ
from most of the wild races, inasmuch as they become perpetuated,
especially in English-speaking countries, by those of more or
less mixed blood.&nbsp; In regard to that I wrote thus in the
Disquisition on the Gipsies:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The fact of these Indians, and the
aboriginal races found in the countries colonized by Europeans,
disappearing so rapidly, prevents our regarding them with any
great degree of interest.&nbsp; This circumstance detracts from
that idea of dignity which the perpetuity and civilization of
their race would inspire in the minds of others&rdquo; (p.
446).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the &ldquo;ordinary inhabitant&rdquo; considers for a
moment what his feelings are for everything Gipsy, so far as he
understands it, he will realize in some degree the responding
feelings of the Gipsies, whatever their positions in life.&nbsp;
These create two currents in society&mdash;the native and the
Gipsy; so that the Gipsy element by marrying with the Gipsy
element, or in the same way drawing in and assimilating the
native blood with it, keeps the Gipsy current in full flow, and
distinct from the other.&nbsp; The Gipsy element, mixed as it is
in regard to blood, never having been acknowledged, necessarily
exists incognito, and in an outcast condition, however painful it
is to use such an expression towards people that have lived so
long in the British Isles, and are frequently of unquestionable
standing in society; with nothing, in many instances, to
distinguish them outwardly from the rest of the population, but
possessing signs and words, and a cast of mind peculiar to
themselves, that is, a sense of tribe and a soul of nationality,
which remain with their descendants.</p>
<p><a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>This
subject is not conventional, but will doubtless sooner or later
become such, as there are things conventional to-day that were
not such lately.&nbsp; In that respect the discussion or even the
sentiments of a prominent person or journal can make a thing
conventional; such is the nature of a highly complex society
anywhere.&nbsp; With reference to this matter I wrote to the
journal alluded to in the following terms:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Surely the strange and unfortunate Gipsy
race and its various off-shoots have not sinned beyond the
forgiveness of the rest of their fellow-creatures, so that what
represents a relatively-large body of British subjects cannot be
acknowledged even by name; leaving to others to look upon or
associate with them as each member of the native race may see
fit.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One would naturally think that the inhabitants of Great
Britain would at least take some little interest in what might be
called their &ldquo;coloured population;&rdquo; and hold in
respect <i>some</i> of its members who could doubtless tell us
much that is interesting on the subject of the Gipsies, so that
that should not be a reproach to them which would be a credit to
others.&nbsp; To do so, and have the people, in some form or
other, acknowledged, is due to the spirits of research and
philanthropy that characterize this age.&nbsp; I admit that there
are many difficulties attending a movement of this kind.&nbsp;
These I have explained fully on previous occasions, and I need
not repeat them here.</p>
<p>In regard to John Bunyan having been of the Gipsy race, I find
that I stated the question in <i>Notes and Queries</i> on the
12th December, 1857; so that it has stood over, like a
&ldquo;case in Chancery&rdquo; under the old system, for a
quarter of a century, unattended to!</p>
<p>This little publication is intended in the first place for the
British Press, although I cannot be expected to send every
journal a copy of it.&nbsp; Each publication in its sphere has an
influence, which should be exercised in the way indicated; for
here there is no opening for the display of those passions that
too frequently enter into discussions generally.&nbsp; For myself
personally (the last to be considered), although it is thirty-one
years since I left Great Britain, I should still have some rights
there; and especially among high-toned people, who should
remember that one of the ends for which they were created was to
see justice done to an absent person.</p>

BUNYAN.<br />
TWO LETTERS TO AN ENGLISH CLERGYMAN. <a name="citation7"></a><a
href="#footnote7" class="citation">[7]</a></h2>
<h3>I.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Your</span> letter of the 14th April
reached me after some delay.&nbsp; When you wrote it I presume
you had not given your fullest consideration to the question
raised by you.&nbsp; For when John Bunyan said that his
&ldquo;father&rsquo;s house was of that rank that is meanest and
most despised of all the families in the land,&rdquo; and that
they were &ldquo;not of the Israelites,&rdquo; that is,
&ldquo;not Jews,&rdquo; he could not possibly have meant that
they were what are generally called &ldquo;natives of
England.&rdquo;&nbsp; Who in Bunyan&rsquo;s time were the
&ldquo;meanest and most despised of <i>all</i> the families in
the land&rdquo;?&nbsp; No one can doubt that they were the
Gipsies, who were numerous and well known to Bunyan.&nbsp; Does
it not then follow that this particular Bunyan family were
Gipsies, in whatever ways and at whatever times its blood may
have got mixed with native, and whatever its social
development?&nbsp; And who then living in England&mdash;when Jews
were excluded from it&mdash;would have taken so much trouble as
Bunyan did&mdash;that is, exhausted every means at his
command&mdash;to ascertain whether their family were Jews but
Gipsies?&nbsp; This Bunyan did, and recorded the fact of his
having done it after he had become an old man.&nbsp; Here we have
no alternative but to conclude that <i>John</i> Bunyan&rsquo;s
family were of the Gipsy race; whatever natives of a similar
surname there might have been in the county or neighbourhood
before the Gipsies arrived there.&nbsp; It is even possible in
this case, as it has taken place in others, that a native family
had been changed into a Gipsy one by the male representative of
it marrying a Gipsy, but not necessarily one following an outdoor
life, and having the issue passed into the Gipsy tribe in the
ordinary way of society.&nbsp; There is neither proof to show nor
reason for holding that John Bunyan&rsquo;s family, in the face
of what he told us, were <i>not</i> Gipsies, but of the ordinary
race of Englishmen; for which reason I think that an honourable
minded man should not maintain it, nor allow it to be asserted in
his presence.</p>
<p>You say that the &ldquo;rank&rdquo; Bunyan spoke of was
&ldquo;the rank of tinkers, not the race of Gipsies.&rdquo;&nbsp;
But tinkering was his calling, while the word rank was only
applicable to &ldquo;his father&rsquo;s house,&rdquo; who
probably did not all follow tinkering for a living.&nbsp; I do
not think that Bunyan used the word tinker anywhere in his
writings; the only allusion to it apparently being at the scene
before Justice Hale, when his wife said, &ldquo;Yes, and because
he is a tinker, and a poor man, therefore he is despised and
cannot have justice.&rdquo;&nbsp; In my Disquisition on the
Gipsies and elsewhere I attached weight to the <a
name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>fact of Bunyan
having been a tinker, as illustrative and confirmatory proof of
his having been a Gipsy, when the name of Gipsy was so severely
proscribed by law; in consequence of which the Gipsies would call
themselves tinkers, to evade the legal and social
responsibility.&nbsp; At the present day it is exceedingly
difficult to ascertain who English tinkers are or were
originally.&nbsp; They will all deny that they are or were ever
related to the Gipsies; and the Gipsies proper will do the
same.&nbsp; I attach no weight to the loose assertions either way
made by people promiscuously, who know little or nothing of the
subject, or merely have a theory to maintain.&nbsp; All this I
have already very fully put in print.</p>
<p>In your letter is a phrase that sounds a little unpleasantly
to my ear.&nbsp; You say, &ldquo;However, whatever may have been
Bunyan&rsquo;s pedigree, he merits honour as a man;&rdquo; which
seems to imply that his memory would have been disgraced if he
had been of the Gipsy race.&nbsp; Why should that have been a
disparagement?&nbsp; This is the entire question at issue.&nbsp;
How could we have expected Bunyan to have said plainly that he
was a member of the Gipsy race in the face of the legal and
social responsibility attaching to the name, as I have
illustrated at great length on various occasions?</p>
<p>I may exaggerate the feeling in question when I say that no
publication will admit the subject into its columns, nor any one
allude to it publicly, or even privately, without something like
losing social caste.&nbsp; As a consequence, no member of the
race that can help it will own the blood unless he wants it to be
known for his benefit.&nbsp; The rest of it, in its various
mixtures of blood, characters, and positions in life, are born
and live and die incognito so far as the rest of the world are
concerned.&nbsp; This is a state of things that should not exist
in England; but there seems no remedy for it unless the question
can meet with discussion, and be taken up by persons of influence
in whom the public has confidence.&nbsp; As I have said on
another occasion, &ldquo;The question at issue is really not one
of evidence, but of an unfortunate feeling of caste,&rdquo; that
bars the way against all investigation and proof.&nbsp; John
Bunyan&rsquo;s nationality forms only a part of the subject of
the &ldquo;Social Emancipation of the Gipsies,&rdquo; but a very
important part of it; but all that might be said of it has no
meaning to such as, looking neither to the right nor the left,
will listen to no representation of any kind of Gipsy but such as
they have been accustomed to see in the open air in England.</p>
<p>It would be uncandid on my part if I refrained from saying
that Bedford and its people have been cited before the bar of the
world to show reason why John Bunyan should not be admitted to
have been &ldquo;the first (that is known to the world) of
eminent Gipsies, the prince of allegorists, and one of the most
remarkable of men and Christians.&rdquo;&nbsp; They have an
opportunity of receiving, first or last, the illustrious pilgrim,
not as the progeny of (as some have thought) native English
vagabonds, but as a Great Original in whatever light he might be
looked at.</p>
<p>In opposition to this view of the great dreamer, we have the
ferocious prejudice of caste against the name of Gipsy, that
leads a person to feel, if not to say, &ldquo;May I lose my right
hand and may I be struck dumb if I admit that he was one of the
race.&rdquo;&nbsp; To him the subject of the Gipsies, in the
development of the race from the tent upwards, and in its complex
ramifications through society, has no interest.&nbsp; To
comprehend it might even be beyond his capacity.&nbsp; To have it
investigated and understood, and the people acknowledged, if it
implied that John Bunyan was to be included as one of them, is
what he will never countenance; on which account his wish is that
the <a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>subject
may remain in perpetual darkness.&nbsp; Proof is not what he
wants, nor will he say what it should consist of.&nbsp; As
regards John Bunyan personally, we have never had an explanation
of what he told us he and his father&rsquo;s family were and were
not; but we may yet see it treated with fanciful interpretations
and comments.&nbsp; Then it has been said at random that he was
&ldquo;not a Gipsy, but a tinker,&rdquo; without considering who
the tinkers really were, and forgetting that a person could have
been both a tinker and a Gipsy; tinkering having been the
Gipsy&rsquo;s representative calling.&nbsp; Then we have the
assertion that he could not have been a Gipsy because of his
fairish appearance, and because his surname existed in England
before the race arrived in it; and consequently that no one
having a fairish appearance and bearing a British name can or
could have been a Gipsy!&nbsp; Then we are told that people
following, more or less, the established ways of English life
during 120 years before the birth of Bunyan could not possibly
have been related in any way to the Gipsies!&nbsp; And finally,
certificates of marriages, births and deaths of people bearing
British names, taken from a parish register, settle the question
that people bearing them were not and could not have been others
than ordinary natives of the British Isles, in no way related to
the Gipsies!&nbsp; In that respect I wrote in the Appendix to the
<i>Reminiscences</i> as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The whole trouble or mystery in regard to
Bunyan is solved by the simple idea of a Gipsy family settling in
the neighbourhood of native families of influence, whose surname
they assumed, and making Elstow their headquarters or residence,
as was the uniform custom of the tribe all over Great
Britain.&nbsp; This circumstance makes it a difficult matter, in
some instances, to distinguish, by the Christian and surnames in
county parish registers, &lsquo;which was which,&rsquo; so far
back as the early part of the seventeenth century&rdquo; (p.
82).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The pamphlet addressed to the &ldquo;University Men of
England&rdquo; explains itself.&nbsp; I think that ministers of
the Church of England should do more for the subject of the
Gipsies, in the light in which I have presented it, than could be
expected from those of other denominations.</p>
<p>With the hope that I have written nothing that can be
considered in any way personally offensive, I remain, etc.</p>
<h3>II.</h3>
<p>In regard to what might be called the
&ldquo;nationality&rdquo; of John Bunyan I said, in my letter of
the 5th May, that &ldquo;the question at issue is really not one
of evidence, but of an unfortunate feeling of caste that bars the
way against all investigation and proof.&rdquo;&nbsp; I do not
know what the congregation of Bunyan&rsquo;s Church at Bedford
consists of, but I presume it is composed of humble people,
engaged in making a living and bringing up their children
becomingly, and indulging in the simple conventionalities
suitable to their positions in life.&nbsp; To ask them even to
entertain the question whether the great dreamer was of the Gipsy
race would apparently horrify them in their simplicity; and it
might be useless to attempt to explain matters so as to
&ldquo;convert&rdquo; them to a belief in it.&nbsp; Proof is
perhaps not what such people want, nor would they all be likely
to be able to say what it should consist of, or to appreciate it
if it was laid before them.&nbsp; It is from no lack of charity
or politeness on my part that I say this, and that I would attach
little weight to what they might <a name="page10"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 10</span>say were they to assert that it is
only proof they require to satisfy them that John Bunyan was of
the Gipsy race; or that the fact of it has not been proved.&nbsp;
He was either of the Gipsy race, of mixed blood, or of the
ordinary English one.&nbsp; What proof is there that he was of
the latter one?&nbsp; If there is no proof of his having been of
the ordinary English race, why assert it, and deny that he was of
the Gipsy one, and refuse to investigate the meaning of what he
said himself and people were and were not, which, if language has
any meaning, clearly showed that he was of the Gipsy race?&nbsp;
Why assume, without investigation, that he was not that, but of
the ordinary English race, even in the face of his calling having
been that of a tinker?</p>
<p>If the congregation of Bunyan&rsquo;s chinch and the people
living in the neighbourhood of it have a difficulty in judging of
evidence in a matter like this, they can have none in explaining,
in a general or more or less crude way at least, their feelings
of antipathy to the idea of the illustrious pilgrim having been
of the Gipsy race; and drawing the logical conclusion that he was
not likely to have said plainly that he was one of it, in the
face of the storm of indignation that seems to be entertained
to-day; an indignation which is so great that it has not yet
found expression.</p>
<p>If some highly educated men have missed the hinge on which the
Gipsy question turns&mdash;that the race perpetuates itself in a
settled condition, irrespective of character and other
circumstances&mdash;and have had a difficulty in realizing it in
all its bearings, we can easily excuse the congregation of
Bunyan&rsquo;s church for holding views similar to those of the
community at large, on a subject that is more or less complex in
its nature.&nbsp; But they can never expect to do justice to it
unless they approach it with every desire to do what is proper,
and not with the rooted aversion with which it has hitherto been
regarded.&nbsp; What Bunyan told us of himself and family he said
was &ldquo;well known to many&rdquo;; and he seems to have
assumed that it was, or would have been, understood by the
world.&nbsp; I have even suggested that he had been more precise
with some of his friends, who might (as they very probably would)
have suppressed what he told them in regard to the nationality of
himself and his &ldquo;father&rsquo;s house.&rdquo;&nbsp; If he
had publicly said plainly that he was of the Gipsy race, that
would have been a <i>fact</i>, which required no
<i>proof</i>.&nbsp; But there was no necessity or occasion for
him to have said what he did.</p>
<p>It appeals to every principle of fair play and abstract reason
that a race that has been in Great Britain for 375 years must be
considered in many respects British, whatever its origin, or
whatever the habits of some of it may be.&nbsp; It would be very
wrong to show and perpetuate a prejudice against the name, or
blood as such, however little or however much there may be of it
in the person possessing and claiming it.&nbsp; Everything else
being equal, such a man, instead of having a prejudice
entertained for him, is entitled to a greater respect than should
be shown to another who labours under no such prejudice in regard
to his blood.&nbsp; Apply this principle to Bunyan and he will
stand higher than he has done.&nbsp; He was evidently a man that
was &ldquo;chosen of God&rdquo; to shine brilliantly among the
children of a common parent; and it becomes all of us to
acknowledge him.&nbsp; It is to be hoped that the congregation of
the church of which he was the honoured pastor will approach this
subject at least with wariness, and not, against all evidence,
reject him who was a divine instrument for the benefit of
humanity, in its highest concernment; merely because he was a
member of a particular &ldquo;family in the land,&rdquo; which
has never yet been acknowledged in any shape or form, however
numerous it is.</p>

LELAND ON THE GIPSIES. <a name="citation11a"></a><a
href="#footnote11a" class="citation">[11a]</a></h2>
<h3>I.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> <i>History of the Gipsies</i>,
by Walter Simson, which I edited and published in 1865, was ready
for the press in 1858.&nbsp; In a prefatory note to it I
said:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;In the present work the race has been
treated of so fully and elaborately, in all its aspects, as in a
great measure to fill and satisfy the mind, instead of being, as
heretofore, little better than a myth to the understanding of the
most intelligent person.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 1872 Mr. Leland published his work on <i>The English
Gipsies and their Language</i>, in which no reference was made to
mine, [that is, my part of it]. <a name="citation11b"></a><a
href="#footnote11b" class="citation">[11b]</a></p>
<p>In 1874 he wrote, for <i>Johnson&rsquo;s Cyclop&aelig;dia</i>,
an article on the Gipsies, in which he made use of the History
proper to illustrate the race in Scotland, and my addition (which
made about half of the book) exclusively to illustrate it in
America, and giving my words.&nbsp; It did not appear from this
article that he had any personal knowledge of the subject, <a
name="citation11c"></a><a href="#footnote11c"
class="citation">[11c]</a> excepting that he said that he knew of
one Gipsy who had travelled from Canada to Texas, as confirmatory
of what I had written; and asserted that &ldquo;there is probably
<i>not one</i> theatre or circus in England or America in which
there are not one or more performers of more or less mixed Gipsy
blood.&rdquo;&nbsp; The only other remark he made of that nature
was the following:&mdash;&ldquo;The reader who will devote a very
few weeks to either Dr. B. Smart&rsquo;s <i>Vocabulary</i>, to G.
Borrow&rsquo;s <i>Romano Lavo Lil</i>, or G. C. Leland&rsquo;s
<i>English Gipsies</i> (London, 1872), can speak the language
better than most English or American Gipsies.&rdquo;&nbsp; In
other words, that any person with tact and a turn to pick up,
remember and use Gipsy words could do just what he had done; and
by going over the same ground produce, in a varied form as
regards circumstances, scenes described by others.&nbsp; It is
exceedingly probable that the work edited and published by me
specially stimulated Mr. Leland to take up the subject so fully
treated in it.</p>
<p>In his book entitled <i>The Gipsies</i> (New York, 1882), Mr.
Leland complains of &ldquo;a reviewer&rdquo; saying of his
<i>English Gipsies and their Language</i> that it &ldquo;had
added nothing to our knowledge on the subject;&rdquo; <a
name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>which was
morally if not literally true, that on the language excepted,
which was mainly an illustration and continuation of the
collections of others, acquired with great labour.&nbsp; He has
made several allusions to my work, without indicating it, such as
frequently using the word &ldquo;Gipsydom,&rdquo; although that
might have been done by any one; which could not have been said
of &ldquo;the old thing&rdquo; (p. 274), which I used on several
occasions to describe a settled Gipsy visiting a Gipsy tent, to
view the style of life of his primitive ancestor.&nbsp; He has
also made unfair allusion to the &ldquo;mixed multitude&rdquo; of
the Exodus as being the origin of the Gipsies, (p. 89); and to
the subject of the Scottish Tinklers or Gipsies, (p. 371).&nbsp;
In <i>The Gipsies</i> he says, &ldquo;No one will accuse me of
wide discussion or padding,&rdquo; (p. 84).&nbsp; That is obvious
to any one, for almost every chapter contains an intolerable
amount of extraneous matter or padding, that has no reference to
the title page or headings of the chapters.&nbsp; In some parts
of the book there are several pages at a stretch&mdash;once as
much as seven pages&mdash;of such extraneous matter; and it would
be interesting to make an analysis of it, line by line, to
ascertain the proportion of the two kinds of matter.</p>
<p>But what I wish more particularly to allude to is Mr.
Leland&rsquo;s discovery that the Gipsies are a tribe from India
that are known there under the name of &ldquo;Syrians,&rdquo; and
therefore not originally natives of India; which latter
conclusion, however, he does not admit, but accounts for the
phenomenon in this way:&mdash;&ldquo;I offer as an hypothesis
that bands of Gipsies who roamed from India to Syria have, after
returning, been called Trabl&ucirc;s or Syrians, just as I have
known Germans after returning from the fatherland to America to
be called Americans&rdquo; (p. 338).&nbsp; That is, a family or
company of Indian nomads returning from a visit to Syria would
afterwards be called, and cause the whole of the race who never
left India to be called, Syrians for ever!&nbsp; Again he
says:&mdash;&ldquo;It will probably be found that they are
Hindoos who have roamed from India to Syria and back again, here
and there, until they are regarded as foreigners in both
countries&rdquo; (!).&nbsp; The allusion to Germans in
illustration is not merely inapplicable, but
unintelligible.&nbsp; Of the &ldquo;Syrians&rdquo; in India Mr.
Leland writes:&mdash;&ldquo;Whether they have or had any
connection with the migration to the West we cannot
establish&rdquo; (p. 339).&nbsp; For this reason he should not
have identified them with the Gipsies out of India.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Their language and their name would seem to indicate it;
but then it must be borne in mind that the word <i>rom</i>, like
<i>dom</i>, is one of wide dissemination, <i>dum</i> being a
Syrian Gipsy word for the race&rdquo; (p. 339); and &ldquo;among
the Copts . . . the word for man is <i>romi</i>&rdquo; (p. 20).
<a name="citation12"></a><a href="#footnote12"
class="citation">[12]</a>&nbsp; &ldquo;Among the hundred and
fifty wandering tribes of India and Persia . . . it is of course
difficult to identify the exact origin of the European
Gipsy&rdquo; (p. 18).&nbsp; For that reason he should not have
written so positively that he had &ldquo;definitely determined
the existence in India of a peculiar tribe of Gipsies who are
<i>par eminence</i> the <a name="page13"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 13</span>Romanys of the East, and whose
language is there what it is in England, the same in vocabulary
and the chief slang of the roads.&nbsp; This I claim as a
discovery, having learned it from a Hindoo who had been himself a
Gipsy in his native land&rdquo; (Pref. iv.).&nbsp; He describes
them as &ldquo;thieves, fortune-tellers and vagrants&rdquo; (p.
339), yet his informant, John Nano, said he was, or had been, one
of them; which would imply that there were different kinds of
&ldquo;Syrians,&rdquo; inasmuch as he was found to be a maker of
curry powder in London, and the husband of an English woman, a
Mahometan by religion, and sufficiently educated to have written
an autobiography, which had unfortunately been burnt.&nbsp;
According to John&rsquo;s account, these &ldquo;Syrians&rdquo;
were &ldquo;full blood Hindoos, and not Syrians,&rdquo; and he
&ldquo;was very sure that his Gipsies were Indians.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The term &ldquo;full-blood Hindoos&rdquo; who are &ldquo;thieves,
fortune-tellers and vagrants,&rdquo; and strollers out of and
back to India, requires explanation.&nbsp; John&rsquo;s
information as to these people being called by the other natives
of India &ldquo;Syrians&rdquo; may be very reliable; but that
they were &ldquo;full-blood Hindoos&rdquo; could have been, at
its best, nothing but a supposition on his part.&nbsp; As I said
in the Introduction to the <i>History of the Gipsies</i>,
&ldquo;I can conceive nothing more difficult than an attempt to
elucidate the history of any of the infinity of sects, castes or
tribes to be met with in India&rdquo; (p. 41).&nbsp; The nature
of the population of India is such that there would hardly be a
possibility of its people at large becoming acquainted with the
movements of a few families of outcasts leaving their race behind
and going to and returning from Syria (if they ever did that), so
as to give the whole race the name of Syrians.&nbsp; The name
must have had its origin from the people having come originally
from Syria, or from parts surrounding it.</p>
<p>In <i>The Gipsies</i> Mr. Leland says that he has
&ldquo;carefully read everything ever printed on the
Romany&rdquo; (Pref. v.); and that it is his &ldquo;opinion that
one ought, when setting forth any subject, to give quite as good
an opportunity to others who are in our business as to
ourselves&rdquo; (p. 88).&nbsp; And yet, although he made
exclusive use of the work I edited and published for parts of his
article in <i>Johnson&rsquo;s Cyclop&aelig;dia</i>, and has
alluded to Messrs. Borrow, Smart, Palmer and Groome, he has
carefully abstained from mentioning my name, however much he may
have been indebted to my work.&nbsp; By referring to it, he
cannot but remember having &ldquo;carefully read&rdquo; the
following:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I am inclined to believe that the people in
India corresponding to the Gipsies in Europe will be found among
those tented tribes who perform certain services to the British
armies; at all events there is such a tribe in India who are
called Gipsies by the Europeans who come in contact with
them.&nbsp; A short time ago, one of these people, who followed
the occupation of a camel driver, found his way to England, and
&lsquo;pulled up&rsquo; with some English Gipsies, whom he
recognized as his own people; at least he found that they had the
ways and ceremonies of them.&nbsp; But it would be unreasonable
to suppose that such a tribe in India did not follow various
occupations&rdquo; (p. 40).&nbsp; &ldquo;What evidently leads Mr.
Borrow and others astray in the matter of the origin of the
Gipsies, is that they conclude that because the language spoken
by the Gipsies is apparently, or for the most part, Hindostanee,
therefore the people speaking it originated in Hindostan; as just
a conclusion as it would be to maintain that the Negroes in
Liberia originated in England because they speak the English
language!&rdquo; (p. 41).&nbsp; [Mr. Leland alludes to this
simile by saying that English spoken by American Negroes does not
prove Saxon descent (p. 20).]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In discussing the question of the origin of the Gipsies with
some English members of the race, I <a name="page14"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 14</span>found that &ldquo;a very intelligent
Gipsy informed me that his race sprang from a body of men&mdash;a
cross between the Arabs and Egyptians&mdash;that left Egypt in
the train of the Jews&rdquo; (p. 14).&nbsp; And I wrote when I
published this, that &ldquo;the intelligent reader will not
differ with me as to the weight to be attached to the
Gipsy&rsquo;s remark on this point.&rdquo;&nbsp; To that question
I devoted ten (13&ndash;23) closely printed pages to demonstrate
that the &ldquo;mixed multitude,&rdquo; or part of it, that left
Egypt with Moses, after separating from the Jews, travelled East
into Northern Hindostan, where they formed the Gipsy caste (p.
21); becoming in every way a people like the Gipsy so far as he
is known to the public to-day.&nbsp; I further said that this
people &ldquo;travelled East, <i>their own masters</i>, and
became the origin of the Gipsy nation throughout the world&rdquo;
(p. 40).</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;What objection could any one advance
against the Gipsies being the people that left Egypt in the train
of the Jews?&nbsp; Not certainly an objection as to race, for
there must have been many captive people or tribes introduced
into Egypt from the many countries surrounding it . . .&nbsp;
That the &lsquo;mixed multitude&rsquo; travelled into India,
acquired the language of that part of Asia, <i>and perhaps
modified its appearance there</i>, and became the origin of the
Gipsy race, we may safely assume . . .&nbsp; Everything
harmonizes so beautifully with the idea that the Gipsies are the
&lsquo;mixed multitude&rsquo; of the Exodus that it may be
admitted by the world.&nbsp; Even in the matter of religion, we
could imagine Egyptian captives losing a knowledge of their
religion, as has happened with the Africans in the New World, <a
name="citation14"></a><a href="#footnote14"
class="citation">[14]</a> and, not having had another taught
them, leaving Egypt under Moses without any religion at
all.&nbsp; After entering India they would in all probability
become a wandering people, and for a certainty live aloof from
all others&rdquo; (pp. 494&ndash;496).&nbsp; &ldquo;If we could
but find traces of an Egyptian origin among the Gipsies of Asia,
say Central and Western Asia, the question would be beyond
dispute.&nbsp; But that might be a matter of some trouble&rdquo;
(p. 40).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this way Mr. Leland&rsquo;s informant, John Nano, if he was
correct in what he said, confirmed my conjecture as to the
Gipsies&rsquo; Egyptian or rather Syrian origin; for after
escaping from Egypt they would remain for some time in Syria or
its neighbourhood before they would become a body and proceed
East.&nbsp; As illustrative of Mr. Leland&rsquo;s desire to
&ldquo;give quite as good an opportunity to others who are in our
business as to ourselves,&rdquo; I find him writing
thus:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Here I interrupt the lady,&rdquo; a writer
on Magyarland, &ldquo;to remark that I cannot agree with her nor
with her probable (!) authority, Walter (!) Simson, in believing
that the Gipsies are the descendants of the mixed races who
followed Moses out of Egypt.&nbsp; The Rom in Egypt is a Hindoo
stranger, as he ever was (!)&rdquo; (p. 89).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The &ldquo;authority&rdquo; was mine, not Walter
Simson&rsquo;s, which Mr. Leland perhaps did not care to
state.&nbsp; One would naturally think that a people who left
Egypt under Moses would be looked upon there as
&ldquo;strangers&rdquo; to-day, rather than that a straggling
family or company of Gipsies returning to India from Syria (if
they ever did that) would cause all their race that never left
India to be called Syrians for ever!&nbsp; According to Mr.
Leland&rsquo;s style of reasoning it would follow that he and
Americans generally could not have originated in England, because
they are &ldquo;strangers&rdquo; there, and are looked upon as
foreigners by the law and by people whose sentiments are not of
the most delicate nature!</p>
<h3><a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
15</span>II.</h3>
<p>Mr. Leland&rsquo;s style of reasoning, his lack of candour,
and his reserve as to how he took up the Gipsy question, and to
whom he had been indebted at first for some of his ideas, detract
very much from the desire that one would naturally have to put
confidence in him.&nbsp; His many confident assertions about what
others have grave doubts and his frequent contradictions have a
similar effect.</p>
<p>In <i>The Gipsies</i> there is very little told us of the race
<i>in</i> America (not <i>American</i> Gipsies) of any kind, and
yet Mr. Leland says that it will</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Possess at least the charm of novelty, but
little having as yet been written on this extensive and very
interesting branch of our nomadic population&rdquo; (Pref.
III.).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In my Preface I said:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;To the American reader generally the work
will illustrate a phase of life and history with which it may be
reasonably assumed he is not much conversant; for, although he
must have some knowledge of the Gipsy race generally, there is no
work, that I am aware of, that treats of the body like the
present&rdquo; (p. 7).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And I illustrated the race in America in notes to the work,
and in as much as I could well introduce in my long Disquisition,
bringing in that part of it which had its origin perhaps from the
settlement of the American Colonies.&nbsp; When Mr. Leland
borrowed from my work for his article in <i>Johnson&rsquo;s
Cyclop&aelig;dia</i> he gave the name of the book with the
<i>London</i> imprint, while from the first page to the last it
showed that it was an <i>American</i> book, based on a
<i>Scotch</i> MS.; and the copy which he used in all probability
bore a <i>New York</i> imprint.</p>
<p>I admit this of Mr. Leland, that, by availing himself of the
hard labours of others, at least to give him a start, he has
added greatly to our knowledge of the Gipsy language, so far as I
know and can judge; but that is nearly all that can be said of
him.&nbsp; What he has told us of the information got from a
native of India as to the Gipsies there being called
&ldquo;Syrians&rdquo; shows that he was merely in good luck in
falling in with the man from whom he obtained it; while, if it is
reliable, it confirms my conjecture, although of that it does not
seem to have been his business to inform the world.&nbsp; His
chapter on the &ldquo;Shelta or Tinkers&rsquo; Talk,&rdquo;
picked up also as it were by accident from a stray tinker, is
indeed of great interest; but the world has reason to question
his judgment when he says that &ldquo;it is, in fact, a language,
for it can be spoken grammatically, and without using English or
Romany&rdquo; (p. 371).&nbsp; Another occasion for questioning
his judgment is when he says that &ldquo;Mr. [Walter] Simson, had
he known the &lsquo;Tinklers&rsquo; better, would have found
that, not Romany, but Shelta was the really secret language which
they employed, although Romany is also more or less familiar to
them all&rdquo; (p. 371); for almost anyone by reading the
<i>History</i> can see the absurdity of it. <a
name="citation15"></a><a href="#footnote15"
class="citation">[15]</a></p>
<p>This book of Mr. Leland (although described in the Preface as
&ldquo;Sketches of experiences among the Gipsies&rdquo;), to
justify its title of <i>The Gipsies</i>, should have been
constructed on some plan and scientifically arranged, with a
great variety of particulars, and no extraneous matter or padding
in it.&nbsp; In place of that we have little but random sketches
or scenes connected with the race.&nbsp; There is no principle
running through it, for we are told in the Introduction that</p>
<blockquote><p><a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
16</span>&ldquo;The day is coming when there will be no . . .
wild wanderers . . . and certainly no Gipsies&rdquo; (p.
15).&nbsp; And after describing how English sparrows have driven
so many kinds of native birds out of Philadelphia, he says,
&ldquo;So the people of self-conscious culture and the mart and
factory are banishing the wilder sort . . .&nbsp; As a London
reviewer said when I asserted in a book that the child was
perhaps born who would see the last Gipsy, &lsquo;Somehow we feel
sorry for that child&rsquo;&rdquo; (p. 15).&nbsp; And in
describing English fairs, as represented by that at Cobham, he
says, &ldquo;In a few years the last of them will have been
closed, and the last Gipsy will be there to look on&rdquo; (p.
142).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Profound research and philosophical observation and reasoning
do not seem to constitute Mr. Leland&rsquo;s forte.&nbsp; It is a
little puzzling to decide how to treat a man like him; for his
&ldquo;confident assertions&rdquo; in regard to the
disappearance, or what some would call the <i>extinction</i>, of
the race are but &ldquo;contradictions&rdquo; of his own
information and opinions; saying nothing of what I published at
great length on the perpetuation of the Gipsies in a settled
state, all of which he admits having &ldquo;carefully
read.&rdquo;&nbsp; Among Mr. Leland&rsquo;s information is the
following:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Go where we may we find the Jew.&nbsp; Has
any other wandered so far?&nbsp; Yes, one; for wherever Jew has
gone there too we find the Gipsy&rdquo; (p. 18).&nbsp; &ldquo;It
. . . . has penetrated into every village which European
civilization has ever touched.&nbsp; He who speaks Romany . . . .
will meet those with whom a very few words may at once establish
a peculiar understanding . . . This widely spread brotherhood . .
. are honestly proud that a gentleman is not ashamed of
them&rdquo; (p. 25).&nbsp; &ldquo;Communities of gentlemanly and
lady-like Gipsies&rsquo;&rdquo; in Russia (p. 25).&nbsp;
&ldquo;All the Gipsies in the country are not upon the
roads.&nbsp; Many of them live in houses, and that very
respectably, nay, even aristocratically.&nbsp; Yea, and it may
be, O reader, that thou hast met them and knowest them not . .
.&nbsp; It is intelligible enough&rdquo; that such a Gipsy
&ldquo;should say as little as possible of his origin, . . . and
ever carefully keep the lid of silence on the pot of his
birth&rdquo; (p. 272).&nbsp; &ldquo;The Gipsy of society, not
always, but yet frequently, retains a keen interest in his wild
ancestry.&nbsp; He keeps up the language; it is a delightful
secret; he loves now and then to take a look at &lsquo;the old
thing&rsquo; [one of my phrases, as I have already mentioned] . .
.&nbsp; I know ladies in England and in America, both of the
blood and otherwise, who would give up a ball of the highest
flight in society to sit an hour in a Gipsy tent, and on whom a
whispered word in Romany acts like wild-fire.&nbsp; Great as my
experience has been I can really no more explain the intensity of
this yearning, this <i>rapport</i>, than I can fly.&nbsp; My own
fancy for Gipsydom is faint and feeble compared to what I have
found in many others&rdquo; (p. 274).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One would naturally conclude that this <i>race</i> is not
disappearing as &ldquo;British birds are chasing American ones
out of Philadelphia&rdquo;; and that it could not be said that
&ldquo;the child is perhaps born who will see the last
Gipsy,&rdquo; even in his primitive condition. <a
name="citation16"></a><a href="#footnote16"
class="citation">[16]</a></p>
<p><a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>Mr.
Leland explains, in his chapter on Cobham Fair, how the Gipsy
problem &ldquo;puzzled and muddled&rdquo; him.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I was very much impressed at this fair with
the extensive and unsuspected amount of Romany existent in our
rural population . . .&nbsp; There were many men in the common
room, mostly well dressed, and decent even if doubtful
looking.&nbsp; I observed that several used Romany words in
casual conversation.&nbsp; I came to the conclusion at last that
all who were present knew something of it&rdquo; (p. 140).&nbsp;
And of eleven kinds of people that were at the fair, he said that
&ldquo;there is always a leaven and a suspicion of
Gipsiness.&nbsp; If there be no descent, there is affinity by
marriage, familiarity, knowledge of words and ways, sweethearting
and trafficking, so that they know the children of the Rom as the
house-world does not know them, and they in some sort belong
together&rdquo; (p. 140).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In my Disquisition on the Gipsies I said:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;In Scotland the prejudice towards the name
of Gipsy might be safely allowed to drop, were it only for this
reason, that the race has got so much mixed up with the native
blood, and even with good families of the country, as to be, in
plain language, a jumble, a pretty kettle of fish, indeed&rdquo;
(p. 427).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Leland continues:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;No novelist, no writer whatever, has as yet
<i>clearly</i> explained the curious fact that our entire nomadic
population, excepting tramps, is not, as we thought in our
childhood, composed of English people like ourselves.&nbsp; It is
leavened with direct Indian blood; it has, more or less modified,
a peculiar <i>morale</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;It is a muddle,
perhaps, and a puzzle; I doubt if anybody quite understands
it&rdquo; (p. 140).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Had Mr. Leland said that, with the exception of myself,
&ldquo;no writer whatever&rdquo; had even alluded to the
phenomenon described, I believe he would have stated what was
true.&nbsp; I endeavoured to explain it in a Disquisition of 171
pages, which he indirectly admitted he &ldquo;carefully
read&rdquo;; so that if I did not &ldquo;clearly explain&rdquo;
the &ldquo;puzzle and muddle&rdquo; it must <a
name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>have
proceeded from a lack of intellect on my part, or on his in not
understanding me.&nbsp; Since then I have frequently expatiated
on and described it, but I am not aware that Mr. Leland has seen
what I wrote on these occasions.&nbsp; In <i>The Scottish
Churches and the Gipsies</i> I said that the Gipsy problem
&ldquo;may at first present an aspect of a &lsquo;labyrinth of
difficulties&rsquo;&rdquo;; but that to solve it &ldquo;there is
little intellect wanted for the occasion, but such as it is it
should be allowed to act freely on the subject of inquiry&rdquo;
(p. 23).&nbsp; To judge of Mr. Leland&rsquo;s works on the
Gipsies one would think that he had been indebted to no one for
anything; so that it is remarkable he should have complained that
<i>novelists</i> should not have &ldquo;clearly explained&rdquo;
to him what he himself should have told us&mdash;particularly as
he spoke of his &ldquo;great experience&rdquo; among the
Gipsies&mdash;unless it appears that even to novelists
he&mdash;as a professional writer taking up a subject that came
to his hand&mdash;has been indebted for putting him on the track
for repeating or illustrating an &ldquo;oft-told tale.&rdquo; <a
name="citation18"></a><a href="#footnote18"
class="citation">[18]</a>&nbsp; We can easily imagine how Mr.
Leland got &ldquo;puzzled and muddled&rdquo; in contemplating his
subject when he says so positively that the Gipsies are
disappearing as &ldquo;British birds are chasing American ones
out of Philadelphia&rdquo;; and that the mixed state of Gipsydom
seen at Cobham Fair &ldquo;was old before the Saxon
Heptarchy&rdquo; (p. 140).&nbsp; What he said he could find in
&ldquo;no writer whatever&rdquo; was elaborately described in the
book which I published.&nbsp; That he used for his own purposes,
and then apparently turned round and threw out his heels at
it.</p>
<p>I have spoken of Mr. Leland&rsquo;s &ldquo;confident
assertions,&rdquo; but I have space merely to allude to some of
them.&nbsp; Among these are the following:&mdash;That there is no
mystery about the origin of the Gipsies (p. 331), and that
&ldquo;it is a matter of history that, since the Aryan morning of
mankind, the Romany have been chiromancing&rdquo; (p. 225); that
&ldquo;among those who left India were men of different castes
and different colours, ranging from the pure Northern invader to
the Negro-like Southern Indian&rdquo; (p. 24); that the Gipsies
in Egypt have lost their tongue (p. 296); that the English Gipsy
cares not a farthing &ldquo;to know anything about his race as it
exists in foreign countries, or whence it came&rdquo; (p. 34);
and that there is hardly a travelling company of dancers,
musicians, singers, or acrobats, or theatre &ldquo;in Europe or
America in which there is not at least one person with some
Romany <a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
19</span>blood&rdquo; (p. 332).&nbsp; This at least is common, I
dare say very common.&nbsp; On one occasion I looked over the
show-bill while in MS. of an English Gipsy company who travelled

<p>The conclusion which I drew of Mr. Leland after reading his
Cyclop&aelig;dia article was that, apart from the language, he
knew little of the <i>subject of the Gipsies</i>.&nbsp; The
knowledge of the language has given him the entr&eacute;e into
the circle of a certain class of the Gipsies, leading to a
&ldquo;flash-in-the-pan&rdquo; knowledge of them; but not
constituting him a reliable guide on the whole question under
consideration; for, in keeping with his &ldquo;confident
assertions&rdquo; generally, he disposes of it by saying that
&ldquo;the child is perhaps born who will see the last
Gipsy.&rdquo; <a name="citation19b"></a><a href="#footnote19b"
class="citation">[19b]</a></p>
<p>As long as Mr. Leland has stuck to his subject he has
confirmed what I said in the work published by me, although he
has made no acknowledgment of it in any way.&nbsp; Even on the
subject of the tinkers in England, he&mdash;so far as he may be
considered an authority&mdash;has confirmed what I said of their
being Gipsies of mixed blood:&mdash;&ldquo;These are but
instances of, I might say, all the English tinkers.&nbsp; Almost
every old countrywoman about the Scottish Border knows that the
Scottish tinkers are Gipsies&rdquo; (p. 508).&nbsp; He also
speaks of John Bunyan having been a &ldquo;half-blood Gipsy
tinker&rdquo; (p. 213).&nbsp; He was only justified in saying
that he was of &ldquo;mixed blood&rdquo;; but he made no allusion
to my long argument (pp. 313 and 506&ndash;523) in defence of it,
which I published in <i>Notes and Queries</i> on the 12th
December, 1857, and illustrated it in two shorter articles in the
early part of 1858, in <a name="page20"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 20</span>which the outline of the <i>History
of the Gipsies</i> was given; so that the question of
Bunyan&rsquo;s nationality has been before &ldquo;all
England&rdquo; for a quarter of a century unanswered.</p>
<p>What I wrote in <i>The Scottish Churches and the Gipsies</i>
is equally applicable to Mr. Leland:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;As I have said of Mr. Borrow, any one
treating of such a subject as the Gipsies should, so far as space
allowed, &lsquo;comment on and admit or reject the facts and
opinions of his case as discovered and advanced by others,&rsquo;
and not &lsquo;put forth his own ideas only, as if nothing had
been said by others before or besides him&rsquo;&rdquo; (p.
12).&mdash;&ldquo;I think that what I have written and published
on the Gipsies should have been treated with more candour and
courtesy, at least with more care and consideration, by others
who have done likewise, saying nothing of the press.&nbsp; I also
think that I have embraced almost all, if not all, of the
principles connected with the existence and perpetuation of the
race; so that others in discussing them should &lsquo;comment on
and admit or reject&rsquo; what I have advanced, and I think
proved, in place of putting forth opinions apparently without due
investigation&rdquo; (p. 14).&mdash;&ldquo;His illustrations of
their language, in common with those of other writers, are very
interesting, . . . and the occasional, as if accidental, remarks
made by the Gipsies, at intervals, bearing on the Gipsy question
proper, are of importance&rdquo; (p. 17).&mdash;&ldquo;He gives
us nothing of the philosophy of the existence, history,
perpetuation, development and destiny of the tribe and its
off-shoots.&nbsp; He seems to use his eyes and ears only, and
with those and his turn for writing he has given us some really
good sketches and scenes . . .&nbsp; But besides using the eyes
and ears in connection with such a subject, it is necessary to
exercise the intellect to discover and explain what is not
obvious or hidden, and illustrate the meaning and bearing of what
is described . . .&nbsp; His book however interesting parts of it
may be, is not calculated to serve any ultimate purpose of
importance; nor is it written in a regular or systematic manner .
. .&nbsp; Nothing can make a subject like that of the Gipsies
attractive (if it can ever be made attractive) to the better
classes of readers, and perpetuate an interest in it, but by
treating it in such a way as will combine a variety of facts,
well arranged and illustrated, and principles; out of which can
be constructed a theory or system that can be discussed and
proved by a reference to the facts and principles given . .
.&nbsp; These writers are useful in their ways, but beyond that
they <i>spoil</i> the subject of the Gipsies, in consequence of
the &lsquo;utter absence in them of everything of the nature of a
philosophy of the subject&rsquo;; which is peculiar to &lsquo;all
the works that have hitherto appeared on the Gipsies&rsquo;
(<i>Dis.</i>, p. 532), so far as I have seen or heard of
them&rdquo; (p. 18).&mdash;&ldquo;A knowledge of the science of
race, in the essential meaning of the word, and especially as it
applies to the Gipsies, cannot be said to be even in its
infancy.&nbsp; Still, it might have been asked, what could two
Scotch Gipsies propagate, in body and mind, but Gipsies?&nbsp;
They certainly could not give origin to Jews or <i>common</i>
Scotch; but Gipsy Scotch or Scotch Gipsy would infallibly
follow&rdquo; (p. 19).&mdash;&ldquo;Of late years a number of
publications and articles, of more or less importance, on the
Gipsies have appeared in Great Britain.&nbsp; Some of these
doubtless had their origin in the work published by me in 1865,
although no acknowledgment was made of it in any way; and yet the
most of the <i>original</i> MS. of it was prepared before Mr.
Borrow had apparently even thought of writing on the race&rdquo;
(p. 17), (that is, between 1817 and 1831).&mdash;&ldquo;If they
really have at heart the desire of knowing and informing the
public &lsquo;all about the Gipsies,&rsquo; why do they so
persistently lead it inferentially to believe that the mass of
information on the subject, in all its bearings, published by me
has no existence?&nbsp; One would naturally think that they would
grasp at it, and illustrate and supplement it; and <i>prove</i>
anything in it to be wrong that they allege or suppose to be so,
and <i>let me hear of their objections</i>&rdquo; (p. 17).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With all his professed candour in regard to <i>all</i> who
have written on the subject of the Gipsies, and cooperating with
his &ldquo;colleagues&rdquo; in connection with it, why did Mr.
Leland not take it up from where it <a name="page21"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 21</span>was left by me, and used by him for
his article in <i>Johnson&rsquo;s Cyclop&aelig;dia</i>!&nbsp; In
place of amusing the world with the fictions that the Gipsy race
is disappearing as &ldquo;British birds are chasing American ones
out of Philadelphia,&rdquo; and that &ldquo;the child is perhaps
born who will see the last Gipsy,&rdquo; he might have assisted
me in &ldquo;breaking down the middle wall of partition&rdquo;
between them and the rest of the world; so that the Gipsy race,
at least in its off-shoots, may be acknowledged openly, and
allowed as such to take their places in society, as &ldquo;men
and brethren,&rdquo; which in many instances they do now,
although unknown to the world.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding all that has been and could be said of Mr.
Leland as a writer on the Gipsies, and of the work under review,
<i>The Gipsies</i>, taking it all in all, is an interesting book,
and deserves to be well read. <a name="citation21"></a><a

23</span>ADVERTISEMENTS.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Ever</span> since entering Great Britain,
about the year 1506, the Gipsies have been drawing into their
body the blood of the ordinary inhabitants and conforming to
their ways; and so prolific has the race been, that there cannot
be less than 250,000 Gipsies of all castes, colours, characters,
occupations, degrees of education, culture, and position in life,
in the British Isles alone, and possibly double that
number.&nbsp; There are many of the same race in the United
States of America.&nbsp; Indeed, there have been Gipsies in
America from nearly the first day of its settlement; for many of
the race were banished to the plantations, often for very
trifling offences, and sometimes merely for being by &ldquo;habit
and repute Egyptians.&rdquo;&nbsp; But as the Gipsy race leaves
the tent, and rises to civilization, it hides its nationality
from the rest of the world, so great is the prejudice against the
name of Gipsy.&nbsp; In Europe and America together, there cannot
be less than 4,000,000 Gipsies in existence.&nbsp; John Bunyan,
the author of the celebrated <i>Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress</i>, was
one of this singular people, as will be conclusively shown in the
present work.&nbsp; The philosophy of the existence of the Jews,
since the dispersion, will also be discussed and established in
it.</p>
<p>When the &ldquo;wonderful story&rdquo; of the Gipsies is told,
as it ought to be told, it constitutes a work of interest to many
classes of readers, being a subject unique, distinct from, and
unknown to, the rest of the human family.&nbsp; In the present
work, the race has been treated of so fully and elaborately, in
all its aspects, as in a great measure to fill and satisfy the
mind, instead of being, as heretofore, little better than a myth
to the understanding of the most intelligent person.</p>
<p>The history of the Gipsies, when thus comprehensively treated,
forms a study for the most advanced and cultivated mind, as well
as for the youth whose intellectual and literary character is
still to be formed; and furnishes, among other things, a system
of science not too abstract in its nature, and having for its
subject-matter the strongest of human feelings and
sympathies.&nbsp; The work also seeks to raise the name of Gipsy
out of the dust, where it now lies; while it has a very important
bearing on the conversion of the Jews, the advancement of
Christianity generally, and the development of historical and
moral science.</p>

<h4>NOTICES OF THE AMERICAN PRESS.</h4>
<p><b><i>National Quarterly Review</i></b>.&mdash;&ldquo;The
title of this work gives a correct idea of its character; the
matter fully justifies it.&nbsp; Even in its original form it was
the most interesting and reliable history of the Gipsies with
which we were acquainted.&nbsp; But it is now much enlarged, and
brought down to the present time.&nbsp; The disquisition on the
past, present, and future of that singular race, added by the
editor, greatly enhances the value of the work, for it embodies
the results of extensive research and careful
investigation.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The chapter on the Gipsy
language should be read by all who take any interest either in
comparative philology or ethnology; for it is much more curious
and instructive than most people would expect from the nature of
the subject.&nbsp; The volume is well printed and neatly bound,
and has the advantage of a copious alphabetical index.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b><i>Congregational Review</i></b>.
(Boston.)&mdash;&ldquo;The senior partner in the authorship of
this book was a Scotchman who made it his life-long pleasure to
go a &lsquo;Gipsy hunting,&rsquo; to use his own phrase.&nbsp; He
was a personal friend of Sir Walter Scott . . .&nbsp; His
enthusiasm was genuine, his diligence great, his sagacity
remarkable, and his discoveries rewarding.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;The book is undoubtedly the fullest and most reliable
which our language contains on the subject.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;This volume is valuable for its instruction, and
exceedingly amusing anecdotically.&nbsp; It overruns with the
humorous.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The subject in its present form is
novel, and we freely add, very sensational.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Indeed, the book assures us that our country is full of
this people, mixed up as they have become, by marriage, with all
the European stocks during the last three centuries.&nbsp; The
amalgamation has done much to merge them in the general current
of modern education and civilization; yet they retain their
language with closest tenacity, as a sort of Freemason medium of
intercommunion; and while they never are wiling to own their
origin among outsiders, they are very proud of it among
themselves.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;We had regarded them as entitled
to considerable antiquity, but we now find that they were none
other than the &lsquo;mixed multitude&rsquo; which accompanied
the Hebrew exode (Ex. XII 38) under Moses&mdash;straggling or
disaffected Egyptians, who went along to ventilate their
discontent, or to improve their fortunes. . . . .&nbsp; We are
not prepared to take issue with these authors on any of the
points raised by them.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b><i>Methodist Quarterly Review</i></b>.&mdash;&ldquo;Have we
Gipsies among us?&nbsp; Yea, verily, if Mr. Simson is to be
believed, they swarm our country in secret legions.&nbsp; There
is no place on the four quarters of the globe where some of them
have not penetrated.&nbsp; Even in New England a sly Gipsy girl
will enter the factory as employe, will by her allurements win a
young Jonathan to marry her, and in due season, the &rsquo;cute
gentleman will find himself the father of a young brood of
intense Gipsies.&nbsp; The mother will have opened to her young
progeny the mystery and <a name="page25"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 25</span>the romance of its lineage, will have
disclosed its birth-right connection with a secret brotherhood,
whose profounder Freemasonry is based on blood, historically
extending itself into the most dim antiquity, and geographically
spreading over most of the earth.&nbsp; The fascinations of this
mystic tie are wonderful.&nbsp; Afraid or ashamed to reveal the
secret to the outside world, the young Gipsy is inwardly
intensely proud of his unique nobility, and is very likely to
despise his alien father, who is of course glad to keep the late
discovered secret from the world.&nbsp; Hence dear reader, you
know not but your next neighbour is a Gipsy.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;The volume before us possesses a rare interest, both from
the unique character of the subject, and from the absence of
nearly any other source of full information.&nbsp; It is the
result of observation from real life.&rdquo;&nbsp; The language
&ldquo;is spoken with varying dialects in different countries,
but with standard purity in Hungary.&nbsp; It is the precious
inheritance and proud peculiarity of the Gipsy, which he will
never forget and seldom reveal.&nbsp; The varied and skillful
man&oelig;uvres of Mr. Simson to purloin or wheedle out a small
vocabulary, with the various effects of the operation on the
minds and actions of the Gipsies, furnish many an amusing
narrative in these pages.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Persecutions of the
most cruel character have embittered and barbarized them. . .
.&nbsp; Even now . . . they do not realize the kindly feeling of
enlightened minds toward them, and view with fierce suspicion
every approach designed to draw from them the secrets of their
history, habits, laws and language.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The age
of racial caste is passing away.&nbsp; Modern Christianity will
refuse to tolerate the spirit of hostility and oppression based
on feature, colour, or lineage.&rdquo;&nbsp; The &ldquo;book is
an intended first step for the improvement of the race that forms
its subject, and every magnanimous spirit must wish that it may
prove not the last.&nbsp; We heartily commend the work to our
readers as not only full of fascinating details, but abounding
with points of interest to the benevolent Christian
heart.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The general spirit of the work is
eminently enlightened, liberal, and humane.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b><i>Evangelical Quarterly Review</i></b>.&mdash;&ldquo;The
Gipsies, their race and language have always excited a more than
ordinary interest.&nbsp; The work before us, apparently the
result of careful research, is a comprehensive history of this
singular people, abounding in marvelous incidents and curious
information.&nbsp; It is highly instructive, and there is
appended a full and most careful index&mdash;so important in
every work.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b><i>National Freemason</i></b>.&mdash;&ldquo;We feel
confident that our readers will relish the following concerning
the Gipsies, from the British Masonic Organ: That an article on
Gipsyism is not out of place in this Magazine will be admitted by
every one who knows anything of the history, manners, and customs
of these strange wanderers among the nations of the earth.&nbsp;
The Freemasons have a language, words, and signs peculiar to
themselves; so have the Gipsies.&nbsp; A Freemason has in every
country a friend, and in every climate a home, secured to him by
the mystic influence of that worldwide association to which he
belongs; similar are the privileges of the Gipsy.&nbsp; But here,
of course, the analogy ceases.&nbsp; Freemasonry is an Order
banded together for purposes of the highest benevolence.&nbsp;
Gipsyism, we fear, has been a source of constant trouble and
inconvenience to European nations.&nbsp; The interest, therefore,
which as Masons we may evince in the Gipsies arises principally,
we may say wholly, from the fact of their being a secret society,
and also from the fact that many of them are enrolled in our
lodges. . . .&nbsp; There are <a name="page26"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 26</span>in the United Kingdom a vast
multitude of mixed Gipsies, differing very little in outward
appearance, manners, and customs from ordinary Britons; but in
heart thorough Gipsies, as carefully and jealously guarding their
language and secrets, as we do the secrets of the Masonic
Order.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Mr. Simson makes masterly
establishment of the fact that John Bunyan, the world-renowned
author of the &lsquo;Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress,&rsquo; was
descended from Gipsy blood.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b><i>New York Independent</i></b>.&mdash;&ldquo;Such a book
is the History of the Gipsies.&nbsp; Every one who has a fondness
for the acquisition of out-of-the-way knowledge, chiefly for the
pleasure afforded by its possession, will like this book.&nbsp;
It contains a mass of facts, of stories, and of legends connected
with the Gipsies; a variety of theories as to their origin . . .
and various interesting incidents of adventures among these
modern Ishmaelites.&nbsp; There is a great deal of curious
information to be obtained from this history, nearly all of which
will be new to Americans.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;It is singular that
so little attention has been heretofore given to this particular
topic; but it is probably owing to the fact that Gipsies are so
careful to keep outsiders from a knowledge of their language that
they even deny its existence.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The history is
just the book with which to occupy one&rsquo;s idle moments; for,
whatever else it lacks, it certainly is not wanting in
interest.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b><i>New York Observer</i></b>.&mdash;&ldquo;Among the
peoples of the world, the Gipsies are the most mysterious and
romantic.&nbsp; Their origin, modes of life, and habits have
been, until quite recently, rather conjectural than known.&nbsp;
Mr. Walter Simson, after years of investigation and study,
produced a history of this remarkable people which is unrivalled
for the amount of information which it conveys in a manner
adapted to excite the deepest interest.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;We
are glad that Mr. James Simson has not felt the same timidity,
but has given the book to the public, having enriched it with
many notes, an able introduction, and a disquisition upon the
past, present, and future of the Gipsy race.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Of the Gipsies in Spain we have already learned much from
the work of Borrow, but this is a more thorough and elaborate
treatise upon Gipsy life in general, though largely devoted to
the tribe as it appeared in England and Scotland.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Such are some views and opinions respecting a curious
people, of whose history and customs Mr. Simson has given a
deeply interesting delineation.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b><i>New York Methodist</i></b>.&mdash;&ldquo;The Gipsies
present one of the most remarkable anomalies in the history of
the human race.&nbsp; Though they have lived among European
nations for centuries, forming in some districts a prominent
element in the population, they have succeeded in keeping
themselves separate in social relations, customs, language, and
in a measure, in government, and excluding strangers from real
knowledge of the character of their communities and
organizations.&nbsp; Scarcely more is known of them by the world
in general than was know when they first made their appearance
among civilized nations.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Another curious
thing advanced by Mr. Simson is that of the perpetuity of the
race . . .&nbsp; He thinks that it never dies out, and that
Gipsies, however much they may intermarry with the world&rsquo;s
people, and adopt the habits of civilization, remain Gipsies,
preserve the language, the Gipsy mode of thought, and loyalty to
the race and its traditions to remote generations.&nbsp; His work
turns, in fact, upon those two theories, and the incidents, <a
name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>facts, and
citations from history with which it abounds, are all skillfully
used in support of them.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;There are some facts
of interest in relation to the Gipsies in Scotland and America,
which are brought out quite fully in Mr. Simson&rsquo;s
book,&rdquo; which &ldquo;abounds in novel and interesting matter
. . . and will well repay perusal.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Pertinent
anecdotes, illustrating the habits and craft of the Gipsies, may
be picked up at random in any part of the book.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b><i>New York Evening Post</i></b>.&mdash;&ldquo;The editor
corrects some popular notions in regard to the habits of the
Gipsies.&nbsp; They are not now, in the main, the wanderers they
used to be.&nbsp; Through intermarriage with other people, and
from other causes, they have adopted more stationary modes of
life, and have assimilated to the manners of the countries in
which they live . . .&nbsp; As the editor of this volume says:
&lsquo;They carry the language, the associations, and the
sympathies of their race, and their peculiar feelings toward the
community with them; and, as residents of towns, have greater
facilities, from others of their race residing near them, for
perpetuating their language, than when strolling over the
country.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;We have no space for such
full extracts as we should like to give.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b><i>New York Journal of Commerce</i></b>.&mdash;&ldquo;We
have seldom found a more readable book than Simson&rsquo;s
History of the Gipsies.&nbsp; A large part of the volume is
necessarily devoted to the local histories of families in England
(Scotland), but these go to form part of one of the most
interesting chapters of human history.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;We
commend the book as very readable, and giving much instruction on
a curious subject.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b><i>New York Times</i></b>.&mdash;&ldquo;Mr . . . has done
good service to the American public by reproducing here this very
interesting and valuable volume.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The work is
more interesting than a romance, and that it is full of facts is
very easily seen by a glance at the index, which is very minute,
and adds greatly to the value of the book.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b><i>New York Albion</i></b>.&mdash;&ldquo;An extremely
curious work is a History of the Gipsies.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The
wildest scenes in &lsquo;Lavengro,&rsquo; as for instance the
fight with the Flaming Tinman, are comparatively tame beside some
of the incidents narrated here.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b><i>Hours at Home</i></b> (<b><i>now Scribner&rsquo;s
Monthly</i></b>).&mdash;&ldquo;Years ago we read, with an
interest we shall never forget, Borrow&rsquo;s book on the
Gipsies of Spain.&nbsp; We have now a history of this mysterious
race as it exists in the British Islands, which, though written
before Borrow&rsquo;s, has just been published.&nbsp; It is . . .
the result of much time and patient labor, and is a valuable
contribution toward a complete history of this extraordinary
people.&nbsp; The Gipsy race and the Gipsy language are subjects
of much interest, socially and ethnologically.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;He estimates the number of Gipsies in Great Britain at
250,000, and the whole number in Europe and America at
4,000,000.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The work is what it professes to
be, a veritable history&mdash;a history in which Gipsy life has
been stripped of everything pertaining to fiction, so that the
reader will see depicted in their true character this strange
people. . . .&nbsp; And yet, these pages of sober history are
crowded with facts and incidents stranger and more thrilling than
the wildest imaginings of the romantic school.&rdquo;</p>

28</span>NOTICES OF THE BRITISH PRESS.</h3>
<h4>THE ENGLISH UNIVERSITIES AND JOHN BUNYAN, AND THE
ENCYCLOP&AElig;DIA BRITANNICA AND THE GIPSIES.</h4>
<p>&ldquo;In this pamphlet Mr. James Simson again does battle in
support of his contention that Bunyan was a Gipsy&mdash;a thesis
first promulgated by him in an elaborate work on the Gipsies,
published in 1865.&nbsp; He is indignant at Mr. Froude for
ignoring the discussion of the question in his recent biography
of Bunyan, and he comments in strong terms on the dicta of Mr.
Francis H. Groome, in the article &lsquo;Gipsies,&rsquo; in the
new edition of the <i>Encyclop&aelig;dia Britannica</i>, that
John Bunyan &lsquo;does not appear to have had one drop of Gipsy
blood.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Mr. Simson&rsquo;s tractate
will be perused with deep interest by all students of the customs
and history of the Gipsies.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Edinburgh
Courant</i>, <i>November</i> 3, 1880.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In this pamphlet Mr. James Simson, editor of
<i>Simson&rsquo;s History of the Gipsies</i>, states his grounds
for believing that John Bunyan was a Gipsy, and invokes the
assistance of the Universities to investigate the matter and put
it beyond the possibility of doubt.&nbsp; It may not matter much
whether or not the &lsquo;immortal dreamer&rsquo; was a Gipsy;
and we do not think Mr. Simson attaches any great importance to
the circumstance <i>per se</i>.&nbsp; What he aims at, we
believe, is to stir up some interest in the Gipsy race, and this
he thinks may be done were the public to have their sympathies
awakened by the fact that John Bunyan was a descendant of
it.&nbsp; By way of supplement, Mr. Simson criticises some
statements made in an article in the <i>Encyclop&aelig;dia
Britannica</i>, on the Gipsies.&nbsp; The curious in the subject
of Gipsy lore will doubtless find in the pamphlet matter that
will interest them.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Perthshire Advertiser</i>,
<i>October</i> 28, 1880.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Simson suggests, and supports, on arguments that
have the highest bearing on anthropological questions, the theory
that John Bunyan was a Gipsy.&nbsp; The great secret that
civilised Europe has even now amongst it a few individuals who
are descended from a Hindoo race, and are capable, by reason of
the fact that they have a particularly original soul of their
own, to reconcile some of the difficulties between the eastern
and the western schools of thought, may be the real future fact
of modern anthropology.&nbsp; The difficulty is, of course, where
and how to find the Gipsies.&nbsp; We have been much pleased with
Mr. Simson&rsquo;s pamphlet.&nbsp; It is not every writer who has
treated the subject in his philosophical manner; and we are glad
to perceive that he strongly accents the fact that a person may
be a Gipsy and yet be entirely ignorant [not absolutely so] of
the Gipsy language.&nbsp; Evidently Mr. Simson has studied
anthropological problems at first hand, and apart from the
speculators who have regarded language as the first key to the
science of man.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Public Opinion</i>,
<i>October</i> 15, 1880.</p>
<h4>CHARLES WATERTON, <span class="smcap">Naturalist</span>.</h4>
<p>&ldquo;That Mr. Simson had a duty&mdash;to himself as well as
to the public&mdash;to perform in justifying his previous remarks
about Charles Waterton, by writing this monograph, is
unquestionable.&nbsp; Although it is a somewhat difficult task
unsparingly to point out the mistakes and shortcomings of a man,
when he can no longer defend himself, without seeming to be
guilty of an offence against the old rule&mdash;<i>Nil nisi bonum
de mortuis</i>&mdash;Mr. Simson may fairly claim credit for
having adhered to the Shakespearian advice in regard to
fault-finding; for, if he has extenuated nothing, he has set down
naught in malice.&nbsp; The example of Charles Waterton, country
gentleman and naturalist, may serve as a useful warning to
students of natural history, by teaching them that only the most
patient investigation and careful reflection can produce results
that will be of real and permanent value to science.&nbsp; They
have here the example of a man who had most excellent
opportunities for such investigations, as well as the strongest
taste for their pursuit, and who, by an exact and systematic
method of study, might have made most important additions to our
knowledge of natural history.&nbsp; But by inaccurate
observation, by a certain looseness of statement, and by taking
things for granted instead of personally verifying them, he has
greatly diminished the value of his labours.&nbsp; Mr. Simson,
though his task is to set right the unduly high estimate in which
the squire of Walton Hall has been held as a man of science,
shows an appreciation of the strong points of his character that
completely takes away any appearance of censoriousness; and his
work incidentally affords an interesting study of the man
himself, who, in his personal life and his enthusiastic devotion
to natural history, showed a strong individuality that is quite
refreshing in this age of
conventionalities.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Aberdeen Journal</i>,

AND PAPERS ON OTHER SUBJECTS.<br />
BY JAMES SIMSON,<br />
<span class="GutSmall">EDITOR OF SIMSON&rsquo;S &ldquo;HISTORY OF

<h4>NOTICES OF THE BRITISH PRESS.</h4>
<p style="text-align: center">Dublin University Magazine, July,
1875.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The principal articles in this volume that have
reference to natural history originally appeared in <i>Land and
Water</i>, and are, in many respects, highly interesting.&nbsp;
Concerning vipers and snakes, we are presented with a good deal
of information that is instructive, not only as regards their
habits generally, but also with respect to points that are in
dispute among naturalists.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;For instance, it
is a vexed question whether, under any circumstances, the young
retreat into the stomach [inside] of the mother snake.&nbsp; A
great authority, [?] Mr. Frank Buckland, affirms that they do
not; while our author is as positive that they do.&nbsp; And he
certainly, with reason, contends that the question is entirely
one of evidence, and, therefore, should be settled &lsquo;as a
fact is proved in a court of justice; difficulties, suppositions,
or theories not being allowed to form part of the
testimony.&nbsp; In support of his own views, Mr. Simson has
collected a large body of evidence that undoubtedly appears
authentic and conclusive.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Of the
miscellaneous papers in this volume, the best is a critical study
of the late John Stuart Mill.&nbsp; Taken altogether, the volume
is very entertaining, and affords pleasing and instructive
reading.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Evening Standard, June 8, 1875.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is with real pleasure we see these Contributions to
<i>Land and Water</i> no longer limited to the columns of a
newspaper, whatever may be its circulation.&nbsp; For the
excellence and charm of these papers we must refer the reader to
the volume before us, which cannot fail to interest and instruct
its readers.&nbsp; Their variety and range may be gathered from
the subjects treated:&mdash;Snakes, Vipers, English Snakes,
Waterton as a Naturalist, John Stuart Mill, History of the
Gipsies, and the Duke of Argyll on the Preservation of the
Jews.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">London Courier, June, 1875.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Natural History Contributions, which are very
interesting, though partaking largely of a controversial nature,
deal chiefly with questions affecting snakes and vipers.&nbsp; Of
the other Contributions, the most attractive and readable is the
one which contests some of Mr. Borrow&rsquo;s conclusions in his
well-known account of the Gipsies.&nbsp; Mr. John Stuart Mill
forms the subject of a slashing dissertation, which is not likely
to find much favour with the friends of the departed
philosopher.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Rochdale Observer, June 19,
1875.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The study of natural history has a peculiar charm for
most people, but for Lancashire folk it seems to have a special
interest.&nbsp; Perhaps the most striking feature of the book at
the head of this notice is the variety of topics touched upon; <a
name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>topics which,
although apparently incompatible and incongruous, are,
nevertheless, both curious and interesting.&nbsp; The author
certainly brings a large amount of special knowledge to the
discussion of the questions he introduces, and the essays are
undoubtedly well written.&nbsp; Our readers will see that the
work is full of controversial matter, embracing natural history,
theology, and biography, and consequently will suit the taste of
those who like to enter into discussions which excite the
feelings, and in which abundance of energy and ability is
displayed.&nbsp; The book is certainly ably written, and the
author shows himself to be a man of large
accomplishments.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Liverpool Albion, June 18,
1875.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The articles are written in a very readable manner, and
will be found interesting even by those who have no special
knowledge of natural history or interest in it.&nbsp; The Gipsies
are competitors with the snakes for Mr. Simson&rsquo;s regards,
and several papers are devoted to these mysterious nomadic
tribes.&nbsp; Perhaps the most curious paper in the volume is
written to prove that John Bunyan was a Gipsy, and a very fair
case is certainly made out, principally from Bunyan&rsquo;s own
autobiographical statements.&nbsp; With the exception of the
papers on John Stuart Mill, to which we have already alluded, and
which are far worse than worthless, the book is one which we can
recommend.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Newcastle Courant, June 11,
1875.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The bulk of these Contributions appeared in <i>Land and
Water</i>.&nbsp; We think the author has done well to give them
to the public in the more enduring form of a well got up
volume.&nbsp; The book contains, also, a critical sketch of the
career of John Stuart Mill; some gossip about Gipsies; and the
Duke of Argyll&rsquo;s notions about the preservation of the
Jews.&nbsp; Altogether, the book is very readable.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Northern Whig, June 17, 1875.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This volume consists of Contributions to <i>Land and
Water</i> by a writer well-known as the author [editor] of a
standard book on the Gipsies, and is evidently the production of
a clear, intelligent, and most observant mind.&nbsp; Mr. Simson
adds a number of miscellaneous papers, including a masterly,
though severe, criticism of John Stuart Mill&mdash;&lsquo;his
religion, his education, a crisis in his history, his wife, Mill
and son,&rsquo;&mdash;as well as several desultory papers on the
Gipsies, elicited, for the most part, by criticisms on his work
on that singular race.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Western Times, June 29, 1875.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The preface to this volume is dated from New York, and
the contents bear marks of the free, racy style of transatlantic
writers.&nbsp; The volume closes with a paper on the
&lsquo;Preservation of the Jews.&rsquo;&nbsp; The writer deals
with his several subjects with marked ability, and his essays
form a volume which will pay for reading, and therefore pay for
purchasing.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Daily Review, June 11, 1875.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We need only mention the other subjects&mdash;Waterton
as a Naturalist, Romanism, John Stuart Mill, Simson&rsquo;s
History of the Gipsies, Borrow on the Gipsies, the Scottish
Churches and the Gipsies, Was John Bunyan a Gipsy? and, of
course, the literary ubiquitous Duke of Argyll on the
Preservation of the Jews.&nbsp; The only paper we have not
ventured to look at is the last, in the dread that on this
question the versatile Duke might be found, as in the matter of
the Scottish Church, verifying the French proverb&mdash;<i>Il va
chercher midi &agrave; quatorze heures</i>&mdash;a work in which
the author of this volume is an adept, in quiet, quaint, and
clever ways, however, which make it interesting.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>FOOTNOTES.</h2>
<p><a name="footnote7"></a><a href="#citation7"
class="footnote">[7]</a>&nbsp; These two letters, dated the 5th
and 19th of May, 1882, were in answer to a short one from a
clergyman of the Church of England, acknowledging the receipt of
a copy of my <i>Reminiscences of Childhood</i>, <i>etc.</i>,
which contained an Appendix on John Bunyan and the Gipsies.</p>
<p><a name="footnote11a"></a><a href="#citation11a"
class="footnote">[11a]</a>&nbsp; The text represents the article
as originally written.</p>
<p><a name="footnote11b"></a><a href="#citation11b"
class="footnote">[11b]</a>&nbsp; I endeavoured, unsuccessfully,
to get another reading of this book before saying that &ldquo;no
reference was made in it to mine.&rdquo;&nbsp; I alluded, from
memory, to <i>my</i> part of it.&nbsp; On examination I find that
the only indirect reference to it is the
following:&mdash;&ldquo;Mr. Simson, in his <i>History of the
Gipsies</i> [that is, in the <i>Disquisition on the Gipsies</i>]
asserts that there is not a tinker or scissors-grinder in Great
Britain that cannot talk this language; and my own experience
agrees with his declaration, to this extent&mdash;that they all
have some knowledge of it, or claim to have it, however slight it
may be,&rdquo; (p. 4).&nbsp; I did not express myself so
absolutely as represented by Mr. Leland, who did not see fit to
mention the double authorship of the book; the subject of which I
took up from where it was left by Walter Simson.&nbsp; This
double authorship may prove a little confusing to the reader when
the book is alluded to.</p>
<p><a name="footnote11c"></a><a href="#citation11c"
class="footnote">[11c]</a>&nbsp; See second note at page 19.</p>
<p><a name="footnote12"></a><a href="#citation12"
class="footnote">[12]</a>&nbsp; In <i>The English Gipsies</i>,
<i>etc.</i>, Mr. Leland writes:&mdash;&ldquo;I asked a Copt
scribe if he were Muslim, and he replied, &lsquo;<i>La</i>,
<i>ana Gipti</i>&rsquo; (&lsquo;No, I am a Copt&rsquo;)
pronouncing the word <i>Gipti</i>, or Copt, so that it might
readily be taken for &lsquo;Gipsy.&rsquo;&nbsp; And learning that
<i>romi</i> is the Coptic for a man, I was again startled; and
when I found <i>tema</i> (tem, land) and other Romany words in
ancient Egyptian (<i>vide</i> Brugsch.&nbsp; <i>Grammaire</i>,
<i>etc.</i>) it seemed as if there were still many mysteries to
solve in this strange language.&rdquo;&nbsp; Of some Egyptian
Gipsies Mr. Leland says that &ldquo;they all resembled the one
whom I have described . . .&nbsp; They all differed slightly, as
I thought, from the ordinary Egyptians in their appearance&rdquo;
(p. 193).</p>
<p><a name="footnote14"></a><a href="#citation14"
class="footnote">[14]</a>&nbsp; Tacitus makes Caius Cassius, in
the time of Nero, say:&mdash;&ldquo;At present we have in our
service whole nations of slaves, the scum of mankind, collected
from all quarters of the globe; a race of men who bring with them
foreign rites, and the religion of their country, <i>or probably
no religion at all</i>.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Murphy&rsquo;s
Translation</i>.</p>
<p><a name="footnote15"></a><a href="#citation15"
class="footnote">[15]</a>&nbsp; Perhaps the most interesting
scene connected with the Gipsy language in Scotland, given in the
<i>History</i>, is that at St. Boswell&rsquo;s (pp.
309&ndash;318).&nbsp; The word &ldquo;Tinkler,&rdquo; assumed by
and applied to the Scotch Gipsies, seems to have been used from a
desire to escape the legal responsibility attaching to the word
&ldquo;Gipsy.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="footnote16"></a><a href="#citation16"
class="footnote">[16]</a>&nbsp; It is not only puzzling, but
provoking to decide how to treat a writer like Mr. Leland, for
sometimes he shows a great deal of knowledge of his subject, and
sometimes apparently nothing of it&mdash;one assertion
contradicting another on the same question.&nbsp; What in reality
has an antipathy between birds, or the idea of &ldquo;people of
self-conscious culture and the man and factory,&rdquo; or the
destiny of the American Indians to do with the destiny of the
Gipsies?&nbsp; For he says, &ldquo;Gipsies in England are passing
away as rapidly as Indians in North America&rdquo; (<i>The
English Gipsies</i>, <i>Pref. X.</i>).&nbsp; As a native of the
United States, Mr. Leland must know that these Indians become
extinct, and of the Gipsies in England that although there are
comparatively few &ldquo;dwellers in tents&rdquo; of full blood,
so called, there are many, many thousands of more or less mixed
blood following various callings, or in various positions in
life, as he has frequently admitted.&nbsp; The distinction
between &ldquo;old-fashioned&rdquo; Gipsies and other members of
the tribe is but trifling with the subject.</p>
<p>The following extracts from <i>The English Gipsies and their
Language</i> are interesting:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Other writers have had much to say of their
incredible distrust of <i>Gorgios</i> and unwillingness to impart
their language, but I have always found them obliging and
communicative&rdquo; (Pref. V.).&mdash;&ldquo;In every part of
the world it is extremely difficult to get Romany words even from
intelligent Gipsies, <i>although they may be willing with all
their heart to communicate them</i>&rdquo; (p.
17).&mdash;&ldquo;Now the reader is possibly aware that of all
difficult tasks, one of the most difficult is to induce a
disguised Gipsy, or even a professed one, to utter a word of
Romany to a man not of the blood&rdquo; (p. 37).&mdash;&ldquo;Be
it remembered, reader, that in Germany, at the present day, the
mere fact of being a Gipsy is still treated as a crime&rdquo; (p.
74).&mdash;&ldquo;Though the language of the Gipsies has been
kept a great secret for centuries, still a few words have in
England oozed out here and there from some unguarded
crevice&rdquo; (p. 78).&mdash;&ldquo;The very fact that they hide
as much as they can of their Gipsy life and nature from the
<i>Gorgios</i> would of itself indicate the depths of singularity
concealed beneath their apparent life&rdquo; (p.
153).&mdash;&ldquo;Behind it all . . . . the fierce spirit of
social exile from the world in which they lived . . . and the
joyous consciousness of a secret tongue and hidden ways&rdquo;
(p. 156).&mdash;&ldquo;A feeling of free-masonry, and of guarding
a social secret, long after they leave the roads and become
highly reputable members of society.&nbsp; But they have a
secret, and no one can know them who has not penetrated it&rdquo;
(p. 174).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With all that has been said, the words which I have put in
italics have a curious meaning&mdash;that the Gipsies in giving
their language to &ldquo;strangers&rdquo; &ldquo;may be willing
with all their heart to communicate them&rdquo;!&nbsp; I have
explained this subject at length in the Disquisition (pp. 281 and
282) in reference to Mr. Borrow and others, not in regard to the
willingness and stupidity, but the shuffling of the Gipsy in
giving the meaning of words, although isolated and abstract ideas
might occasionally puzzle some of them; for they translated to
Mr. Borrow the Apostles&rsquo; Creed, sentence by sentence.&nbsp;
The Lord&rsquo;s Prayer, given by Mr. Borrow, Mr. Leland admits
to be &ldquo;pure English Gipsy&rdquo; (p. 70).&nbsp; I do not
think Mr. Leland states, with what stock of words and how
acquired, he first approached the Gipsies, and how he used them,
to get inside of the guard of the tribe.</p>
<p><a name="footnote18"></a><a href="#citation18"
class="footnote">[18]</a>&nbsp; In the Preface to <i>The English
Gipsies and their Language</i>, Mr. Leland says that all that it
contains &ldquo;was gathered directly from the Gipsies
themselves&rdquo; (v.); that he did not take &ldquo;anything from
Simson, Hoyland, or any other writer on the Romany race in
England&rdquo;; and that nothing is a &ldquo;re-warming of that
which was gathered by others&rdquo; (x.).&nbsp; All that appears
strictly true; yet he says nothing of how he was &ldquo;put on
the track for repeating or illustrating an &lsquo;oft-told
tale.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; But he says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;If I have not given in this book a sketch
of the history of the Gipsies, or statistics of their numbers, or
accounts of their social condition in different countries, it is
because nearly everything of the kind may be found in the works
of George Borrow and Walter Simson&rdquo; (xi.).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He did not find much of the kind mentioned in Mr.
Borrow&rsquo;s books, so far as I remember, and omitted to say
that I had written very fully on the points stated.&nbsp; It
would have been interesting to have been told by Mr. Leland about
his being &ldquo;puzzled and muddled&rdquo; at what he saw at
Cobham Fair, how he came to write, nine years before that, as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;There have been thousands of <i>swell</i>
Romany chals who have moved in sporting circles of a higher class
than they are to be found in at the present day&rdquo; (p.
92).&mdash;&ldquo;It may be worth while to state, in this
connection, that Gipsy blood intermingled with Anglo-Saxon, when
educated, generally results in intellectual and physical
vigour&rdquo; (p. 174).&mdash;And where was it that he found the
idea that John Bunyan was a member of the Gipsy race (p. 63), if
it was not as elaborately given in my Disquisition?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="footnote19a"></a><a href="#citation19a"
class="footnote">[19a]</a>&nbsp; One of Mr. Leland&rsquo;s
&ldquo;confident assertions&rdquo; is that &ldquo;the English
Gipsy cares not a farthing &lsquo;to know anything about his race
as it exists in foreign countries, or whence it
came&rsquo;&rdquo;; which is not a fact.&nbsp; He seems to have
misinterpreted the <i>English Gipsy</i> peculiarity which
assimilates <i>in appearance</i> to the <i>native English</i>
one, as I have written thus in the <i>History of the
Gipsies</i>:&mdash;&ldquo;Though Gipsies everywhere, they differ
in some respects in the various countries which they
inhabit.&nbsp; For example, an English Gipsy of pugilistic
tendencies will, in a vapouring way, engage to <i>thrash</i> a
dozen of his Hungarian brethren&rdquo; (p. 359).&nbsp; And of the
more mixed kind of Gipsies, I have said:&mdash;&ldquo;In Great
Britain the Gipsies are entitled, in one respect at least, to be
called Englishmen, Scotchmen, or Irishmen; for their general
ideas as men, as distinguished from their being Gipsies, and
their language indicate them at once to be such, nearly as much
as the common natives of these countries&rdquo; (p.
372).&mdash;What is described very fully throughout the
<i>History</i>, and especially in the note at pp. 342 and 343,
about the different colours or castes of the Gipsies, meets Mr.
Leland&rsquo;s remarks about those who left India.&nbsp;
Thus:&mdash;&ldquo;What are full-blood Gipsies, to commence
with?&nbsp; The idea itself is intangible; for, by adopting, more
or less, wherever they have been, others into their body, during
their singular history, a pure Gipsy, like the pure Gipsy
language, is doubtless nowhere to be found&rdquo; (p. 342).</p>
<p><a name="footnote19b"></a><a href="#citation19b"
class="footnote">[19b]</a>&nbsp; With the limited space at his
disposal for his cyclop&aelig;dia article, Mr. Leland could not
be expected to tell us much in it about the Gipsies.&nbsp; In it
he says that &ldquo;their hair seldom turns gray, even in
advanced age, unless there be &lsquo;white&rsquo; blood in their
veins&rdquo;; that, &ldquo;like North American Indians, the
Gipsies all walk with their feet straight&rdquo;; and that
&ldquo;there are nearly 100 English Gipsy family names, most of
which are represented in America.&rdquo;&nbsp; And
further:&mdash;&ldquo;At the present day the Romany is the life
of the entire vagabond population of the roads in England, it
being almost impossible to find a tinker or petty hawker who is
not part Gipsy.&nbsp; There are now but a few hundred
full-blooded <i>tent</i> Gipsy persons in England (1874), but of
. . . house-dwellers, who keep their Gipsy blood a secret, and of
half-breeds . . . or of those affiliated by blood, all of whom
possess the great secret of the Romany language to a greater or
less degree, there are perhaps 20,000.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The
tinkers in England are all Gipsies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Including <i>all</i> of &ldquo;the blood&rdquo; in
<i>various</i> positions in life, there are doubtless
<i>vastly</i> more of the tribe in England than 20,000,
considering the time they have been in the country, and the
healthy and prolific nature of the race.</p>
<p><a name="footnote21"></a><a href="#citation21"

United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as

  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
